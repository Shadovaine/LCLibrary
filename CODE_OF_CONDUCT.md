# Code of Conduct — Linux Command Library

## Purpose
This project exists to help people learn Linux. My goal is to keep it welcoming, helpful, and safe so contributors of all backgrounds can participate.

## Scope
This Code applies in all project spaces: GitHub issues, discussions, PRs, commits, docs, and any community channels linked from the repo.

## Standards

### Be excellent to each other
- Be respectful, patient, and constructive.
- Assume good intent; ask for clarification before jumping to conclusions.
- Give helpful reviews (actionable, specific, kind).

### No-go behaviors
- Harassment, hate speech, personal attacks, or trolling.
- Doxxing or sharing private info.
- Sexualized language or imagery.
- Dismissive “RTFM”-style replies; gatekeeping.
- Off-topic disruption, spam, or bad-faith arguing.

### Technical safety
- Destructive or dangerous commands must be clearly labeled, sandboxed, and justified for education.
- No malware or intentionally harmful content.

## Reporting
If something feels off, report it privately:

- **Primary contact:** shado.sec@proton.me  
- Include: links/screenshots, context, timestamps, and any previous attempts to resolve.

I will acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe and keep reports confidential to the extent possible.

## Enforcement
- **1. Gentle nudge:** Maintainer clarifies expectations.
- **2. Warning:** Written warning with specific behavior to change.
- **3. Temporary limits:** Mute, issue lock, or PR freeze.
- **4. Removal:** Blocking from the repo if behavior continues or is severe.

Maintainers may take any action necessary to maintain a safe, productive environment.

## Attribution
Parts of this policy are inspired by common open-source community guidelines and the spirit of the Contributor Covenant.

## Updates
This document may evolve. Material changes will be noted in the repo changelog or release notes.
